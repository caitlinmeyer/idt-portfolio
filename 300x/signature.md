### Overview
When published guidelines and point-of-care information resources such as UpToDate or DynaMed Plus do not have the answer to clinical questions, healthcare professionals turn to the journal literature. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) are considered the ideal type of study to determine, without bias, the benefit or harm of an intervention and are often sought as evidence-based, authoritative sources of information to answer questions about complicated clinical scenarios. However, healthcare professionals do not have time to read lengthy and complex documents.

The goal of this module is to prepare third-year medical students in their clinical clerkships for the situation laid out above. By the end of the unit, students will be able to look at an RCT, quickly locate key pieces of information about the study design, and use a tool called a critical appraisal worksheet to evaluate the evidence. This unit will live in a series of online self-directed learning activities the students can access during their clerkship year.

### Before you start
Before jumping into reading, it's a good idea to know exactly what you're looking for. Constructing a well-built clinical question is crucial to saving time and having a more focused literature searching and reading experience. Check out the video below for tips on how to frame a clinical question using the PICO tool.

### Now that you have a question
What exactly *is* an RCT? Why are they so important? Listen to this brief podcast for a little historical context:

### Anatomy of an RCT
Peruse the annotated digital document below to learn more about the common components of an RCT and see them in context.

### Critical appraisal

Before investing the time in reading the entire RCT report, the first stage of critical appraisal is a **high level screening evaluation** of the paper. Ask yourself: 
1. Does the study content match the clinical question? Consider your PICO.<BR>
2. Is the study design appropriate for your clinical question type? Consult the table below: 
  
| Question type | Study type                                       |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Diagnosis     | prospective, blind comparison to a gold standard |
| Therapy       | randomized controlled trial > cohort study       |
| Prognosis     | cohort study > case control > case series        |
| Harm/Etiology | cohort study > case control > case series        |



Next, you'll collect information from the report to assess the validity of the study design and execution. The graphic below will tell you what you're looking for and where to find it.

After you gather this information, it's time to calculate the number needed to treat. For easy to understand instructions on calculating experimental event rate, experimental control rate, absolute risk reduction, and, finally, number needed to treat, check out this great video from [Sketchy EBM](https://sketchyebm.com):
