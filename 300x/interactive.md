For week 7, we had to try an authoring tool we hadn't used before. I chose Rise by Articulate. I found the tool very intuitive, user-friendly, and I love the way the final content looks. I made a short module reviewing the anatomy of an RCT, the key elements of critical appraisal of RCTs, and a quiz on where to find each element.

You can preview the module [here](https://rise.articulate.com/share/7fJwYn-q5Ed9IU8dLd54Q-BrwUqlrS3C).
