<h3><a href="/idt-portfolio/300x/video">Instructional Videos</a></h3>
This two week module included creating two videos from storyboard to finish using tools of our choice. I used Audacity for audio, Hype 3 for visuals and Camtasia to assemble the project. For the second video captions were added with Camtasia.
<h3><a href="/idt-portfolio/300x/audio">Audio</a></h3>
This module focused on decoupling video and audio, and meditating on what the audio format has to offer as a vehicle for learning.
<h3><a href="/idt-portfolio/300x/interactive">Interactive</a></h3>
This module had us create an interactive learning experience on the authoring platform of our choice. I used Rise by Articulate.
<h3><a href="/idt-portfolio/300x/signature">Signature Assignment</a></h3>
The Signature Assignment: Strategically Reading + Critically Appraising Randomized Controlled Trials intends to provide third year medical students key skills needed to quickly find evidence and determine its quality. It is the cumulation of the skills developed in this course and contains: an annotated PDF (digital document), an original video with captioning, edited images (into a header and a handout), original images, an interactive module, two OERs, and reflections on all of these media and why they're a good fit.
