You'll see and hear below a segment of audio I recorded.

By the end of listening to this brief audio segment, the audience will have a basic understanding of what an RCT is and why itâ€™s a desirable study design for making clinical decisions.

I had initially thought video for conveying this information. However, when I started brainstorming visuals, I realized they wouldn't be compelling. This assignment provided the opportunity to think about audio's value as a format and what types of information it works best for.
