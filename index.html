<h1>Hello!</h1>
My name is Caitlin Meyer and I am a Research & Education Librarian at Yale's <a href="https://library.medicine.yale.edu">Cushing/Whitney Medical Library</a>. I teach in the curriculum in the Yale School of Medicine, coordinate the library workshop program, and am currently exploring the expansion of our online education offerings.  Prior to Yale, I was a member of the <a href="https://uclalibrary.github.io/research-tips/">WI+RE Team at UCLA Library</a>.<BR><BR>
On this site, you will find my assignments for the <a href="https://www.edx.org/micromasters/instructional-design-technology">Instructional Design & Technology MicroMasters</a> program offered by edX and UMUC. You can navigate through each course by using the 100x, 200x, 300x, and 400x links in the navigation bar above. <BR><BR>
