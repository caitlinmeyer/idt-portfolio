title: Comparing Learning Theories

---

Soon, you'll see a table comparing the learning theories we discuss in class. For now, feel free to scroll down to learn about specific theories. 

### <a name="behaviorism"></a>Behaviorism
*Background:* Behaviorism has its origins in psychology in the late 19th/early 20th century. Focusing on objective facts and behaviors as ways to discern meaning and understanding instead of trying to decipher the innerworkings of consciousness, it was a departure from dominant paradigm of the time. Watson and, later, Skinner are the big names tied to this theory. In thinking about behaviorism with regards to education, the instructor's goal is to foster certain behaviors in their students by providing the appropriate prompts that would elicit said behavior. This is accomplished with a lot of repetition, question and response type activities, and positive/negative feedback where needed. <BR><BR>
*Example:* Teaching adults how to use a counterintuitive but important computer program called EndNote. To be successful using this program, you need to memorize sequences of clicking, therefore behaviorism could work well here. The instruction is built around a series of tasks that the instructor demonstrates, then the students do it. While the students attempt the tasks, the instructor walks around and praises those who have completed the task. Such tasks may include successfully downloading references from PubMed then importing them or automatically downloading PDFs for references in the library. At the end, the instructor asks a series of questions (stimuli) that the students go through and answer (response) reflecting the day's learning. These could include, "What file formats can EndNote accept references in?" "How do you modify your favorites list?"

### <a name="constructivism">Constructivism

*Example*: (Building on the behaviorism scenario laid out above). An additional learning objective could be, now that the students know how to add citations to papers, when should they cite things in their writing? This is perfect to think about with regards to constructivism instead of behaviorism because it's such a culturally variable practice and where students have come from (heritage, previous institutions, disciplines, etc.) is going to hugely matter. Skills in ZPD would be: distinguishing between original thought and thought influenced by other works that warrants a citation and also identifying situations in writing that necessitate citations (quotations, paraphrasing, summarizing, facts/information/data). A social constructivist activity - students could be given a section of an article with all of its citations stripped. They would have a short amount of time to note where they think citations likely belong, then they will discuss with another student their answers. The pair must present what they talked about back to the bigger group, leading to a dicsussion of citation norms in US academia.
